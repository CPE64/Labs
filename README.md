# Labs for CPE/EEE 64
This repository contains a set of labs for an introductory logic course. The goal is to introduce the DE0-Nano development kit for Terasic and the Quartus development for altera. These tutorials make use of Quartus' block diagram functionality as well as Verilog design entry. 

Each lab is made up of three parts in this repository. The lab manual is written in LaTeX and the source code is contained in the LabManual directory. Screencasts are referenced in the lab manual and expand upon it's content. Screencasts are included in their own directory. Most of the labs also include Quartus projects or and System Verilog  test benches. 

##text of labs
To find the rendered text of the lab manual look in an individual lab's folder. For example lab2/manual.pdf would be the text of lab two. These rendered documents will be included with changes to the source Latex.
