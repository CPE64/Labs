\section{ Introduction}
  \PARstart{I}{n} this lab we will look at the applications and different types of state machines. We will walk through a number of examples from Altera's technical documentation to investigate the different types of state machines available to the digitial designer and why you might choose a particular one.This lab is intended to introduce the student to the following concepts:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Logic primitives on a FPGA
       \item Quartus development environment
       \item Synthesis of a block based design
       \item Assigning pins for a design
       \item Programming an Altera FPGA
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Included Screencasts}
      A number of screencasts are included with this set of labs. They are available on Youtube and as zipped MP4s on the course website. They are intended to be short and to the point so they cover individual topics.

  %| The Case Statement
  %| =================================================================================================
  \section{The Case Statement}
    \IEEEPARstart{V}{erilog} makes use of the case statement like most other programming languages. The case statement provides a clear way for your code to step through a procedure. It is common to implement a state machine using the case statement for a number of reasons.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Enumerated state names show up in Signaltap for easy debugging.
      \item The organized syntax creates more readable code.
      \item easily expandable to include more states.
    \end{enumerate}

    It is important to note that logic implemented with the case statement could be modeled with multiple If-Else statements. Most designers choose to use the case statement because of it's concise readable format.

  %| The state machine
  %| =================================================================================================
  \section{The state machine}
    \IEEEPARstart{T}{his} lab will assume that you have had a basic introduction to state machines in the lecture. We will cover some topics that are particular to the FPGA and HDL implementation of the logic. Altera offers a number of templates for the creation of a state machine\cite{Altera:QuartusHandbook}
      
      \subsection{4-State Mealy Machine:} This style of logic was coined in George Mealy's 1955 paper “A Method for Synthesizing Sequential Circuits.” The trademark feature is that it's outputs are determined by both the current state and the current inputs. A mealy machine typically requires less states to perform the same operation as a Moore machine. Output defined in transitions. typically more flexable \cite{Wikipedia:MealyMachine}
      
      \subsection{4-State Moore State Machine:} created a year after the Mealy machine the Moore Machine was described in a 1956 paper Gedanken-experiments on Sequential Machines. The difference is the Moore machine is only dependant on it's current state. Output defined in states. \cite{Wikipedia:MooreMachine}

      \subsection{User-Encoded State Machine:} This can be incorporated into all of the previous types. It allows the states to be named which aids in debugging and overall code readability. Signaltap can also be configured to show the named state values for ease of debugging. ScreencastX shows the use of encoded states in Signaltap.

      \lstinputlisting[caption=Example of enumerated state machine\cite{Sunburst:FSMs}]{./Codesnips/StateMachineExample.sv}
      Let's take a look at why the author of this code recomends this particular style of coding.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item The combinational always block sensitivity list is sensitive to changes on the state variable and all of the inputs referenced in the combinational always block.
        \item The combinational always block has a default next state assignment at the top of the always block.
        \item Default output assignments are made prior to the case statement (this eliminates latches and reduces the amount of code required to code the rest of the outputs in the case statement and highlights in the case statement exactly in which states the individual output(s) change).
        \item In the states where the output assignment is not the default value assigned at the top of the always block, the output assignment is only made once for each state.
        \item There is an if-statement, an else-if-statement or an else statement for each transition arc in the FSM state diagram. The number of transition arcs between states in the FSM state diagram should equal the number of if-else-type statements in the combinational always block.
        \item For ease of scanning and debug, place all of the next assignments in a single column, as opposed to placing in line next assignments that follow the contour of the RTL code.
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Important recommendations from altera}
      Quartus will recognize when you have created a state machine during synthesis. This will allow Quartus to optimize the design based on the known behavior of state machines. The Quartus II handbook offers the following recommendations for writing state machines that we will follow.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Assign default values to outputs derived from the state machine so that synthesis does not generate unwanted latches.
        \item Separate the state machine logic from all arithmetic functions and data paths, including assigning output values.
        \item If your design contains an operation that is used by more than one state, define the operation outside the state machine and cause the output logic of the state machine to use this value.
        \item Use a simple asynchronous or synchronous reset to ensure a defined power-up state. If your state machine design contains more elaborate reset logic, such as both an asynchronous reset and an asynchronous load, the Quartus II software generates regular logic rather than inferring a state machine.
      \end{itemize}

    {DE0-Nano configured with control design}
    {Output LEDs will be inspected for proper operation as the student controls the LED}

  \subsection{Binary sequence detector}
    A common use of a state machine is to recognize a sequence in an incoming signal. This can be useful when you want to take action on a specific trigger. This style of trigger is very common in digital bus systems. You will be given a digital sequence to write a detector for. The Analog Discovery's  digital output can be used to generate your test signal. Illuminate the LED's on the  Nano for one second once the signal has been detected.
